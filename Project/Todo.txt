*(No good, cannot because PS won't run .NET 4.0)1. Remove the need for the Sedodream.Publish.proj MSBuild file
	- This should be done by creating a PS wrapper for the TransformXml task and using that instead of MSBuild
*(No good, just prompt in PS)2. Create a WPF form to help configure the publish process
	- It should have at a minimum the MSDeploy endpoint info, but later it should also show the MSDeploy
	- parameters in the package and what not.
	- Could also have an interface where users could exclude files
*3. Get the list of environmets by looking at the transforms which are available and pass that to the WPF form
*(No good)4. Figure out how to get Powershell to run in the context of .NET 4.0 instead of 2.0
*5. Support for -whatif
*6. Skip _Deploy folder on publish
*7. Replace web.config with transformed web.config on publish 
*8. Skip web.*.config from getting published
*(No good, conditional check in import is good enough)9. When the package is uninstalled remove the files that were dropped on disk during install
*10. Add condition to the import
*11. Replace WebApp.dll with Slowcheetha.dll
12. Create a web.config which blocks all the files in the _deploy_ folder
*13. When adding .wpp.targets make sure it gets into the solution so that it gets checked in
*14. Rename to publish-interactive.ps1
*15. Make transforming web.config optional
*16. When a user publishes spit out the command line to avoid all the prompts
*17. Update the name of the folder which is written to temp (base if off the project name)
*18. Update the passed in parameters to escape the " character, currently it's not possible to have a param with a " inside of it
*19. Add some parameters to this process
		*AllowUntrusted
		*Auth type
*20. Remove all the messages which are written to the Nuget window on install
*21. If the transform fails stop the publish process
*22. Write a file which has all the parameters and then feed that into the command.
*23. Remove all the comments when the package is installed
24. Better error messages on failure
25. Add ability to specify the transform file by file path
*26. Update all $e = to | Out-Null
*27. Update .nuspec file
28. Transfer code to github.com
     Update .nuspec file with the URL after this is done.
29. Re-organize code to be easier to understand and not having stuff under SampleWeb
